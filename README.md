# Public and Private Key Messaging Project
This project was developed as part of a class exercise to understand how public and private keys work and how messages can be securely sent between a sender and a server using these keys. The project consists of two main components: the sender (Emisor) and the receiver (Receptor).

## Project Overview
The project demonstrates:

1. Generating RSA key pairs (public and private keys).
2. Encrypting a message with a public key.
3. Sending the encrypted message over a network.
4. Decrypting the message with a private key.

##Technologies Used
- C#
- .NET Framework
- TCP Networking
- RSA Encryption
